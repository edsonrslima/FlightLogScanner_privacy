# Flight Log Scanner – Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 25 September 2025  
**App:** Flight Log Scanner (iOS/iPadOS)  
**Owner:** Alliance Airlines (internal tool)  
**Contact:** [elima@allianceairlines.com.au]

> This is an internal enterprise application used by authorized personnel. It is not a consumer app.

## Summary

- OCR and parsing happen **on-device**.  
- Data leaves the device **only** when you explicitly submit/email a report.  
- Submissions are sent via **Microsoft Graph** to approved operational recipients.  
- No selling of data. Minimal diagnostics only for stability and support.

## What We Process

- **Scans & inputs:** Flight logs (images/PDF), extracted fields, user-entered details.  
- **Identity:** Your work account for SSO and Microsoft Graph.  
- **Device/app info:** Model, OS, app version; limited to compatibility and support.

## On-Device First

- Local processing and local temporary storage (app sandbox/offline queue).  
- Nothing is uploaded unless you submit.

## When You Submit

- **Route:** Microsoft Graph (TLS) using your enterprise sign-in.  
- **Recipients:** Base emails and/or central reporting address configured by Alliance.  
- **Where it ends up:** Corporate mailboxes and downstream systems governed by Alliance retention and access controls.

## Security

- iOS/iPadOS sandboxing, device passcode/biometrics, MDM/Intune policies (if enabled).  
- TLS in transit; role-based access on the server side.

## Your Controls

- Review, edit, or delete before sending.  
- Delete local history/queue in the app.  
- For enterprise records requests, contact the privacy inbox above.

## Legal & Retention

- Legitimate interests/performance of duties; aviation compliance support.  
- On-device: user-controlled.  
- Enterprise systems: per Alliance policy/regulation.

## Providers

- Apple (camera, Vision/OCR, OS services)  
- Microsoft Graph/Entra ID (auth & email)  
- Alliance enterprise platforms (mail, SharePoint/OneDrive, pipelines)

## Updates & Contact

Policy may change as the app evolves.
